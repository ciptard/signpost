Title: A Little Bit About Me
-->

Hi, I'm David Gauld. I'm a **Software Engineer** at IBM, a **web designer/developer** and a Computer Science undergraduate from Portsmouth, England.

I'm a keen advocate of open source software, therefore most of my code is available for all to see on [GitHub](http://github.com/dcgauld). I have created/contributed to many projects and tools including [a real-time collaboration tool](http://chattro.com), [a mobile JavaScript game](http://team3b.github.io/Puckt), [a flat file CMS](http://github.com/dcgauld/Markdown-CMS) and [a tool for sharing colour palettes](http://github.com/dcgauld/Palettes.io). I've also designed and developed websites for [Chattro](http://chattro.com), [BUGs Netball](http://bugsnetball.co.uk), [T-Shirts And More](http://t-shirtsandmore.co.uk) and [Fitro](http://fitroapp.com).

I play the drums in a [band](http://facebook.com/capitalfuzz) and the piano for a [choir](http://lowrygirls.moonfruit.com). I enjoy Japanese food, building Lego and a good pot of tea.

I've met the Queen, played music to over 500 people, had a personal tour of BBC television centre, cheered on Usain Bolt at London 2012, achieved a grade 8 in clarinet, stood in front of 10 Downing Street and shaken Michael Buble's hand.

You can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dcgauld), view my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/dcgauld), connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/dcgauld) or send me a good old fashioned [email](mailto:dcgauld@gmail.com).
