Title: Homeless Shelter Volunteering
*/

Last Friday, me and a group of 10 other IBMers went to a local homeless shelter in Southampton to help re-paint several rooms and corridors.

The homeless shelter, ran by the Society of St. James, is an essential part of many people's lives. It provides help and support for up to 10 residents, sometimes from very different backgrounds, at a time. During their stay, regular visits and checkups ensure that the time they spend there is not only short-lived, but beneficial for their future.

Our day started off with a small briefing from the builder that would be helping us out, before getting to work on giving some of the rooms a lick of paint.

After a whole day of painting, the results looked fantastic. It was a greatly rewarding, especially knowing that people's lives were made just that bit happier after a relatively small amount of effort.
